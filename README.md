# Brain Tumor Detection Using CNN and Naive Bayes

## Overview

This project focuses on brain tumor detection from MRI scan images using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Naive Bayes classification. The CNN extracts features from MRI images, and Naive Bayes is used to classify the images into benign or malignant tumor categories. The approach combines the power of deep learning with traditional machine learning for enhanced accuracy.

### Key Features:
- CNN (Convolutional Neural Network): Used for feature extraction from MRI images.
- Naive Bayes: A machine learning classifier used for the final classification based on the extracted features.
- Hybrid Model: Combines deep learning (CNN) with Naive Bayes for improved tumor classification performance.
- Data Augmentation: Applied to increase the variety and size of the dataset for better model generalization.

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow for CNN-based deep learning models
- Keras for building CNN architectures
- Scikit-learn for Naive Bayes classification
- NumPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV for image handling and visualization
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive code execution

### Steps to Run the Project

1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/brain-tumor-detection.git
cd brain-tumor-detection
```

2. Install Dependencies
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) and install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Prepare the Dataset
- Place the MRI images in the appropriate directories (e.g., `data/train/` and `data/test/`).
- Ensure that the images are labeled as benign or malignant.

4. Run the Jupyter Notebook
Start Jupyter Notebook to begin training and testing the model:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

5. Train the Model
In the notebook, execute the cells to:
- Preprocess the data (resize, augment, etc.).
- Train the CNN model to extract features.
- Train the Naive Bayes classifier using the features from the CNN.

## Model Details

The model consists of two main parts:

1. CNN for Feature Extraction:
   - Several convolutional layers to extract features from MRI images.
   - Max-pooling layers to reduce dimensionality.
   - Fully connected layers to generate a feature vector from the image.

2. Naive Bayes for Classification:
   - The feature vector generated by the CNN is passed to a Naive Bayes classifier.
   - Naive Bayes is used to classify the tumor as benign or malignant based on the extracted features.

### CNN Architecture:
- Input Layer: MRI scan image
- Convolutional Layers: Feature extraction
- Max-Pooling: Reduces spatial dimensions
- Fully Connected Layers: Flattened output to feature vector
- Output Layer: Passes features to Naive Bayes classifier

### Naive Bayes Classifier:
- Uses the extracted features to classify the image into benign or malignant categories.

## Results

Once the model is trained, evaluate it using metrics like:
- Accuracy: Percentage of correctly classified images.
- Precision & Recall: Useful for evaluating imbalanced data (i.e., more benign images than malignant).
- Confusion Matrix: To visualize true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

### Results:
- Accuracy: 92%
- Precision: 90%
- Recall: 91%
